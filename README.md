node-red-contrib-tak-registration
=================================

A <a href="http://nodered.org" target="_new">Node-RED</a> node to register to a TAK server, to help send wrap files as datapackages for TAK, and to create simple markers from json messages.

**NOTE**: NOT yet for production use.

## Install

Run the following command in your Node-RED user directory - typically `~/.node-red`

    npm i node-red-contrib-tak-registration

## Usage

Registers a TAK gateway node and sets up a heartbeat.

Works in conjunction with a TCP request node, set to point to the TAK server tcp address and port
(usually 8087 or 8089), set to return strings, <i>keep connection open</i> mode, and split on "&lt;/event&gt;".

It can send various types of messages to TAK.

### Standard COT event

If the `msg.payload` is an XML string it will be passed directly though.

### Sending data packages...

requires a msg containing the following properties

 - **sendTo** - *string|array* - can either be an individual TAK callsign, an array of callsigns, or **broadcast**
to send to all users, or **public** to just upload the package to the TAK server.
 - **topic** - *string* - the overall package name - IE what you want it to be called on the TAK device (keep it short).
 - **attachments** - *array of objects* - each object must contain at least a **filename** (string) and *content** a buffer of the file/data, for example `[{filename:"foo.kml", content: <buffer of the file>}]`
### Sending marker position...

To create or update a simple marker send a msg with the following property

 - **payload** - *object* - a "standard" node-red worldmap format msg.payload containing `name, lat, lon, type or SIDC, (alt), (speed), (bearing), (layer)`, where type is the CoT type eg a-f-g-u or the SIDC is the standard mil 2525C code, eg SFGPU. The layer will get turned int a hastag which can then be selected on/off in the TAK app.

### Updating gateway position...

To update the location of the gateway dynamically the node can accept a payload

 - **payload** - *string|object* - Either a string starting `$GPGGA` or an object containing `lat` and `lon` and optional `alt` properties (but no name property).

### Details

This should work almost directly with messages received from an email-in node for example - but you will need to add the recipients in the sendTo property and may need to filter out unwanted messages first.
